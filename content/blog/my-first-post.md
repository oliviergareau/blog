# Hello world!

This is my first post using [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) which is a static site generator written in go. After many painful attempts to use a simple CMS (not Wordpress!) that would behave well with Docker, I have found static site generators to be quite attractive. Jekyll would have been a solid pick as well, but I have decided to give hugo a shot!
